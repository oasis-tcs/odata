A server offering an OData Service communicates with clients using that protocol and may offer respones to requests in several formats. This document describes the OData Atom Format, which is one of these possible formats. If the mime type application/atom+xml has been requested by the client, the response of any conforming server must follow the nromative rules declared in this document.\n\"\"\"\n\nalso maybe we should motivate the special ordering we had in mind for the 15 items long listing of what an OData payload might represent.\n\nI do not know enough about the OData model (hopefully yet :-) to classify the special terms: single, sequence, collection or set,  in the context of the listing. \nDoes the imagined reader do so at this point? Could we for instance move / merge the items \n- a single link to a related entity\n- a collection of links to related entities\nalso as \n- a link to a related entity \ninto the first grouping below? Or is collection special, and must be preserved (but then, are collections of primitve values not possible)?\n\nOne possible rewrite (sorry for my non-native english) for the listing in the introduction could be:\n\"\"\"\nAn OData payload may for instance represent single occurences or sequences of:\n\n- a primitive value\n- a structured (\"complex\") value\n- an entity (a structured type with an identity)\n\nListed without any specific ordering, other objects represented by the payload may be:\n\n- a media resource\n- a single instance of a mime type\n- a single link to a related entity\n- a collection of links to related entities\n- a service document describing the collections (entity sets) exposed by the service an xml document describing the entity model exposed by the service\n- an error indication\n\nIn the context of batch requests the payload may also indicate:\n- a batch of requests to be executed in a single request\n- a set of responses returned from a batch request\n\"\"\"\n\nWhat do you think? If this listing is exhaustive we should state that and if is not we should also state this, shouldn't we?\n\n\nAccepted: https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/48346/odata-meeting-26_on-20130221-minutes.html#odata-178\n\nImported from [ODATA-178](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-178)",

Where navigation properties exist between the entitysets these provide a natural and convenient mechanism for building queries that span entitysets. However, where navigation properties are not present a way is needed to build such cross-entity spanning queries.\n\nIn the context of looking at aggregation we came up with a solution for doing this by considering the entitycontainer as the cross-product of the contained entitysets. You could then $expand the entitysets you wanted to join, and add a filter to specify the equivalent of the join condition. This seemed generally useful beyond just the scope of aggregation.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdvanced clients MAY request cross-joins, i.e. posing queries (based on other join conditions, with $expand for the entity sets to be joined, and add $filter to specify the equivalent of the join condition) in the case where the spanning entity sets are not all related by an association . \nTo enable this potentially useful capability, the server SHOULD allow requests to be rooted at the entity container, and in doing so the latter MUST either provide explicit navigation properties in the model (i.e. where useful navigations exist) or MUST define implicit navigation properties with cardinality \"to one\" to each entity set (and potentially each function) it contains, so that queries across entity sets could be supported by referring to properties qualified by entity set. \nIn any of the two cases, the entity container SHOULD be annotated in the same way as entity sets to express which aggregate queries are supported. \n\n(For an example please see inside comments.)\n\nAccepted: https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/48622/odata-meeting-30_on-20130321-minutes.html#odata-165\n\nImported from [ODATA-165](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-165)",

In this context think about augmenting the Entity Data Model (EDM) with annotations adding analytic type context to the model and some basic grouping/aggregation functionality (min/max/sum/average/count/distinct-count, provider specific and rule based aggregations) based on the data exposed in the EDM.\n\nTo craft a proposal, at least for me further information is needed:\n\n1. Is there a 'better place' for 'advanced analytics' capabilities added to OData ?\n2. what does  'advanced analytics' capabilities actually paraphrase ?\n3. What context is indicated with 'In this context think about augmenting ...' is it \n3.a the imagined 'advanced analytics' not being serviced by the current document or\n3.b the content being served by this document (i.e. 'OData Extension for Data Aggregation') ?\n\nExpecting the answer to 3 as 3.b I would suggest - and I am willing to help craft a readable 'infoset' - rewrite Abstract and Introduction to yield well separated readable views on this extension. As of now, I have to read further to understand a minimum about that topic, but after that I may come up with suggestions for abstract and Introduction. \n\nOne remark w.r.t. abstracts: I would refrain from 'additional formal structuring' of content (as in this case with an itemized list). Abstracts IMO are meant (and work best) as english prose, which carries clarity and shows structure only in and by itself, i.e.  by choice of the right words and phrases that make it up.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAbstract:\nThis specification adds basic grouping/aggregation functionality (min, max, sum, average, count, distinct-count) to OData without changing any of the base principles of OData.\n\n1 Introduction\nThis specification adds the notion of aggregation to OData without changing any of the base principles of OData. It defines a representation and semantics for aggregation of data, especially:\n•\tSemantics and operations for querying aggregated data,\n•\tResults format for queries containing aggregated data,\n•\tAnnotations to indicate what can be aggregated, and how.\n\n\n\nImported from [ODATA-161](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-161)",

It goes on to say that the responses in a changeset must be 1:1 with the requests, but does not say they must be in the same order, and does not say how a client correlates a response within a changeset with a particular request within that changeset.\n\nChangesets do describe the use of a content-id header for allowing a statement within a batch to reference the results of a previous statement within the batch. For example, to add an order to a customer that was added within the same batch. However, it does not say that it is mandatory for the client to specify the content-id header for requests within a batch, nor does it say that it is mandatory for a service to return content-id headers supplied within the batch.\n\nIt seems simplest to say that clients SHOULD specify a content-id header for requests within a changeset, and that service MUST return the content-id (if any) specified by the client. This allows the service to re-order changes within the changeset without having to buffer the response, and is arguably simpler for the client to correlate responses without having to rely on ordering.\n\n### Proposal\n\nClients MUST specify a content-id header for each request within a changeset.\nServers MAY return responses within a changeset in any order.\nServers MUST include the content-id header in each response, so clients can correlate requests and responses.\n\nAccepted: https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/47764/latest/odata-meeting-19_on-20121220-minutes.html\n\nImported from [ODATA-157](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-157)",

It even could appear in related entities, e.g. the description of one of the products ordered.\n\nThis is comparable to Level 0 Conformance in CQL, see [ODATA-3](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-3).\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a system query option $search with the following search syntax:\n\nSearch for entities that contain a word\n\n   $search=foo\n\nSearch for entities that contain all of several words\n\n   $search=foo bar\n   $search=foo bar baz\n   $search=foo AND bar\n   $search=foo AND bar AND baz\n\nSearch for entities that contain any of several words\n\n   $search=foo OR bar\n   $search=foo OR bar OR baz\n\nGrouping is supported using parenthesis\n   $search=foo AND (bar OR baz)\n\nSearch for entities do not contain a word\n\n   $search=NOT foo\n   $search=foo NOT bar\n   $search=foo NOT bar NOT baz\n\nNOT affects only the word following immediately, so the following two are equivalent:\n\n   $search=foo NOT bar baz\n   $search=foo baz NOT bar\n \nSearch for exact phrase\n\n   $search=\"foo bar\"\n   $search=\"foo bar baz\"\n\nThe result contains only entities that match both $search and $filter, so there's a logical AND between the two.

The characters \"[\", \"]\", \"{\", \"}\", and DQUOTE (\") are very important in JSON constructs and not percent-encoded by IE9, Chrome22 and Firefox15 when occurring in the query part, although RFC3986 requires it. Safari5 on the other hand correctly percent-encodes them.\n\nThe conservative choice for a normalization rule here would be that these characters are percent-ENcoded before applying the grammar to produce \"legal\" URIs. A more readable approach (at least for those test cases passing JSON constructs as parameters) would be to require percent-DEcoding for these special characters in the query part, which is unproblematic as they have no special meaning there.\n\nIf the latter, more readable approach is chosen, it could also be applied to SPACE and HTAB, resolving [ODATA-127](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-127) on the side of readability.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd the following comment to the beginning of the ABNF construction rules:\n\n; The following rules assume that URLs have been percent-encoding normalized as described in section 6.2.2.2 of RFC3986\n; (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6.2.2) before applying the grammar to them, i.e. all characters in the unreserved set \n; are plain literals and not percent-encoded.\n; In addition the characters SPACE, HTAB, DQUOTE, \"{\", \"}\", \"[\", and \"]\" must also be stated as plain literals and not percent-encoded\n; when occuring in the query part.\n\nAccepted: https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/47172/latest/odata_meeting-11_on-20121011-minutes.html\n\nImported from [ODATA-137](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-137)",

On the client it requires understanding parsing each element to determine whether or not it has the special \"target\" attribute indicating it should be interpreted as an annotation. When interpreting the value of a structured annotation, the parser has to understand properties in this special namespace, rather than the odata data: namespace used to parse non-annotation properties.\n\nIt would be all together easier if we defined an Annotation element in the OData metadata: namespace. This would make it easy for parsers that wanted to identify, or ignore, annotations to do so. Properties within structured annotations should be in the OData data: namespace, so that parsers could interpret the data within a structured annotation the same as any other structured value.\n\n### Proposal\n\nReplace Section 8, Instance Annotations, within the [Atom] document with the attached https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/document.php?document_id=47077&wg_abbrev=odata which defines an \"Annotation\" element within the OData metadata: namespace for instance annotations in Atom.\n\nAccepted: https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/47172/latest/odata_meeting-11_on-20121011-minutes.html\n\nImported from [ODATA-135](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-135)",

For example, the <atom:link> element defines attributes for rel, href, title and so forth. These attributes are not in the atom namespace, because atom defines the element. This allows the link element to be written without having to namespace qualify all of the attributes, as:\n       <atom:link rel=\"...\" href=\"...\" title=\"...\"/>\n\nNote that attributes do not inherit the namespace of their element (or any other implicit namespace); unprefixed attributes always live in an empty namespace.\n\nCurrently , a number of elements defined within the odata namespace have attributes that are (erroneously) defined within that namespace. This would require each attribute to be namespace qualified, as in:\n      <edm:Property edm:Name=\"FirstName\" edm:Type=\"Edm.String\"/>\n\nThis was not the intention, and not how the examples are shown.\n\n### Proposal\n\nGo through the attributes of elements defined with the CSDL and ATOM documents and remove the namespace from attributes defined within elements defined by OData.

That is approximately 12 (11.57) microseconds per second. The point here is that allowing for microsecond precision in DateTime(Offset) values in this case would amount to a \"false\" precision (the value may be less \"accurate\" than it is \"precise\"), given the variable length of seconds from day to day (the day before the leap second is observed, and the day the leap second is observed).\n\nNow while I appreciate that the lexical representation of date/times in OData V3 allows seconds=60 and that therefore presumably the intention was to support leap seconds, OData is likely to be used frequently together with HTML5 (which does not permit leap seconds or sub-millisecond precision), so I would recommend that OData should align with HTML5 and disallow leap seconds and sub-millisecond precision.\n\nSee also: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2010/04/08/precision-and-accuracy-of-datetime.aspx\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nFrom 2012-11-7 face to face: \n-Leap seconds are not supported; valid values are 0-59. \n\nFor Precision:\n-MUST be 12 or less, SHOULD be 7 or less.
