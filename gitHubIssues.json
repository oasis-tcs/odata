Prefer is (as always) a hint which can be ignored by the service. In the absence of the odata-vocabularies preference, the service is free to decide which vocabulary elements to return.\n\nThe most specific identifier always takes precedence (so a specific namespace takes precedence over *). The behavior if the same identifier value is specified to both be excluded and included is undefined; the service may return or omit the specified vocabulary but must not raise an exception.\n\nServices MAY include the Preference-Applied header in the response to specify the specific vocabularies that may have been included in the response where appropriate but SHOULD NOT specify * or excluded vocabularies.\n\nExamples:\n\nInclude all vocabularies, including documentation elements within a metadata document:\n    Prefer: odata-vocabularies=\"*\"\nDo not include any vocabularies or documentation elements:\n    Prefer: odata-vocabularies=\"\"\nInclude only documentation elements:\n    Prefer: odata-vocabularies=\"Edm.Documentation\"\nInclude all vocabularies, but exclude documentation elements within a metadata document:\n    Prefer: odata-vocabularies=\"*,-Edm.Documentation\"\nInclude only vocabularies defined directly under the odata namespace:\n    Prefer: odata-vocabularies=\"odata\"\nInclude only vocabularies defined anywhere within the odata namespace:\n    Prefer: odata-vocabularies=\"odata.*\"\n\nAccepted: https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/47355/latest/odata_meeting-14_on-20121101-minutes.html\n\nImported from [ODATA-34](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-34)",

What value of precision should be specified for the return type of the function, remembering that the function should be usable across multiple implementations? The same issue arises if I would like to define a compare_datetime function. What value of precision should I use for the two function parameters.  \n\n\n### Proposal\n\nNote that it is valid to define a custom function that returns a datetimeoffset value without specifying precision.\n\nFor this specific issue (function that returns current datetime) have proposed, in [ODATA-13](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-13), a new canonical function now(), that returns the current datetimeoffset value.\n\nAccepted: https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/47764/latest/odata-meeting-19_on-20121220-minutes.html\n\nImported from [ODATA-15](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-15)",

CQL has been around for many years and is in use in diverse communities to provide interoperable access to various data stores.\n\nCQL provides much simpler more intuitive syntax that does not have the restrictions noted above. Here is a simple example of a complex query for a fictitious MovieCatalog context:\n\nmovie.genre = \"history\" AND movie.year > 1980 AND movie.year < 1982 AND movie.actor = \"*Quinn*\"\n\nIt seems easily possible to define a CQL profile for ODATA that would specify how CQL queries are invoked as part of an ODATA RESTFul query. \nThe following is a possible way to express this CQL query in a RESTFUL GET:\n\nGET /v2/Catalog/search?query=movie.genre = \"history\" AND movie.year > 1980 AND movie.year < 1982 AND movie.actor = \"*Quinn*\" HTTP/1.1\n\nNote above query is shown without the required url encoding for convenience.\n\nThe result would be:\n\n- a more functional query protocol\n- based on existing OASIS specification with established use in several communities\n- easier syntax for query client\n- Easier to map to existing data stores with less hardwiring between logical and physical schema\n\nSome additional points are:\n\n- Get by ID does not get impacted\n- Will need to define a odata context for CQL\n- ODATA context will define ODATA specific indexes, relations, relation modifiers (options/parameters) etc. to support odata specific features such as functions, operators, granularity of data returned etc. \n\n[SearchRetrievePt5]\n\nsearchRetrieve: Part 5.
